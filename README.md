## Whats Missing?

To display my abilities i thoought of transformings this project into a small SaaS where travels can save nice spots in the cities and share a brief description with pictures., consider the following enhancements:

Component Libraries:

Use component libraries like Shadcn to improve the UI/UX of your application. Shadcn provides pre-designed components that are easy to integrate, enhancing the overall look and feel.

Deployment:

Deploy the application using Vercel. Vercel provides a seamless deployment process for Next.js applications with built-in CI/CD, automatic SSL, and global CDN capabilities. Simply push your changes to a connected GitHub repository, and Vercel will handle the rest.

Backend Integration:

Integrate Prisma as an ORM for managing your database interactions. Use PostgreSQL as a database to store user accounts and saved addresses efficiently. Define your data models in Prisma and perform CRUD operations seamlessly.

Payment Processing:

Integrate Stripe for subscription payments. This will allow you to manage different subscription tiers, handle payments, and provide a secure checkout experience for your users. Use Stripe's API to create subscriptions, manage billing, and provide invoices.

Authentication Management:

Implement Kinde for user authentication and management. Kinde provides an easy way to handle user signup, login, and user session management, ensuring a secure experience for your users.
By incorporating these elements, you can expand the Address App into a robust SaaS product that provides value to users while ensuring scalability and maintainability.
